## Goal of the Journey:
Build a Protfolio of 5 Android Apps with different features and components.

**Today's Progress**: I Started my second Android App to track time spent on personal projects: defined App Goals, created sketches and wireframes, built activity_main layout and editor_dialog layout.

### Day 3: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I Worked on adding a new project into database and displaying project infos using ListView and CursorAdapter. Didn't complete it though ;)

**Today's thoughts**: I learned how to perform autocompletion by using AutoCompleTextView. For every new App developed, it is important to set new challenges and learn new things.

### Day 5: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Powering AutoCompleteTextView from a cursor using CursorAdapter and implemented query and insert methods in ContentProvider.

**Today's thoughts**: I feel my progress is becoming too slow. Inserting data into database and displaying it back isn't a trivial task. I hope achieving noticeable progress in the next few days.
